### Part I
- *git* command creates a branch? `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge? *fast forwards can only happen if there have not been commits on the original branch while the new branch is being worked on*
- *git* command changes to another branch? `git checkout`
- *git* command deletes a branch? `git branch -d <branch-name> or git branch -D`
- How do merge conflicts happen? *When Git cannot determine what file or folder to choose when merging since there have been different commits with changes to the same file*
- ### **Part II**
Practice with fast forward and recursive merges: Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.
Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
